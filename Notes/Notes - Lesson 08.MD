Generating Local Admins Across Hosts

sysprep: 

    I can use the sysprep command in the windows terminal to strip a windows installation of its unique identifiers (SID) etc, so that it can be imaged/cloned easily without the domain complaining that it appears to be a cloned mirror copy of another workstation.
