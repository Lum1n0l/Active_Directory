Compromising Windows Hosts with Impacket

Moving into using Kali to exploit some of our new local admins within our AD environment. 

I have explored using the impacket suite, specifically smbexec, psexec and wmiexec in order to try and obtain a shell on our workstations and controllers by supplying it with a local admin username and password as previously discovered using crackmapexec.
